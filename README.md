📄 chatbot.txt Example

Hello! I am a chatbot designed to help you with your questions.
I can provide information about technology, programming, and general knowledge.

If you say hello, I will greet you.
If you ask me for help, I will try my best to assist you.
If you want to exit, just type "bye".

Some common questions I can answer:
- What is Python?
- How does machine learning work?
- What are some programming languages?
- How can I start learning AI?

Feel free to ask me anything!
You can edit this file to add your own questions and answers. The chatbot uses it as a base to respond.

💬 Sample Conversation

User: hello  
Bot: hi there

User: What is Python?  
Bot: I'm still learning. Please ask another question.
The chatbot handles greetings and fallback responses if it can't understand.

💡 Future Improvements
Add keyword matching for better FAQ support

Integrate with Dialogflow or OpenAI (ChatGPT)

Build a GUI using Tkinter or a web version using Flask/Streamlit

Add voice capabilities (Text-to-Speech)
